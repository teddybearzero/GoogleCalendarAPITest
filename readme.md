Iâ€™m was successful in making Get requests but had issues with Post requests. 
Error: 403 - "Insufficient Permission: Request had insufficient authentication scopes."

I then made a number of changes to the google auth that then broke 
the get request. Hopefully the code while show what I tried to achieve. 

A little more time is needed to understand the Google Auth process.
